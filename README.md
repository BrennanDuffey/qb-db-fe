# QB-DB

## Description

This solo project is a simple site built over 6 days. This is a simple site in which students and coaches can use to hone their NAQT knowledge, through quizes or study sheets.
## Setup

Simply start by cloning the front-end repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrennanDuffey/qb-db-fe.git
```

In the same folder you cloned the repository also clone the back-end repository with 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BrennanDuffey/qb-db-be.git
```

Once you have cloned the repo, to install the library dependencies cd into the folders just created and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Once everything is installed in both folders, in the back-end folder, run `npm start` in your terminal, you should see "Something is running on http://localhost:3000/".  Now opening a separate tab in the terminal cd into the front-end repository and run `npm start` you're default browser should open a tab to http://localhost:3001/ if not simply go to http://localhost:3001/ in your preferred browser.
